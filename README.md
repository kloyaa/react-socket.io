<h1>A Simple Create React App with Sockets</h1>
<p>Socket.IO is a JavaScript library that enables real-time, bidirectional, and event-driven communication between a client and a server. It allows for real-time data transfer, enabling two-way communication between the server and client in web applications. Socket.IO uses WebSockets under the hood, but it also supports other fallback techniques for browsers that do not support WebSockets. Socket.IO provides a layer of abstraction on top of the WebSockets API, making it easier to use. Here is a high-level overview of how Socket.IO works:
    <br/>
<br/> Client sends a request to the server to establish a connection.
<br/> Server accepts the connection and starts listening for events.
<br/> Client and server can send and receive events in real-time.
If the connection is interrupted, Socket.IO will automatically try to re-establish it using its fallback mechanisms.
<br/><br/>
Socket.IO provides a set of APIs for both the client-side and server-side to interact with each other. The client-side API enables sending and receiving events from the server, while the server-side API allows sending and receiving events from clients. The API is simple and easy to use, allowing developers to build real-time applications with ease.
<br/>
Overall, Socket.IO is a powerful tool for building real-time web applications, and it is widely used in various domains such as online gaming, chat applications, and collaboration tools.
